In 2014-15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50-40-90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017 and 2018, where they won back-to-back titles.

Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, he also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made.

During the 2012-13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history. The 2012-13 season saw Curry and teammate Klay Thompson earn the nickname of the Splash Brothers, with the pair going on to set the NBA record for combined three-pointers in a season with 484 in 2013-14, a record they broke the following season (525) and again in the 2015-16 season (678).

## Analysis
```{r out.width='80%', echo= FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/gsw-shot-chart.png')
```


* We see that Iguodala in general didn't have a lot of shots comparing with others. This may be due to his own position: shooting guard while others for example, curry is point guard. By checking the distribution of shots, we also see many interesting facts. For example, curry has shots in each range 0-100,100-200, and over 200, while Green for example, doesn't have a lot of shots in 100-200. If we want to dig futher, we should count the shots in those three ranges and compute the frequncies of each player to see their 'preference' and whether or not they fit their positions.


* now we check the **effective shooting percentage** by showing three tables: Effective Shooting % by Player, 2PT Effective Shooting % by Player, and 3PT Effective Shooting % by Player
* We first show Effective Shooting % by Player we see that actually Iguodala has the best perc_made! However, this doesn't really mean that he is better than curry since he just made 371 shots while curry made 1250 shots. It is possible that Iguodala would only shot when he finds a situation that he is very confident that he would make it or otherwise he will pass to his teeamattes.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
es = summarize(group_by(df,name),total = n(),made = sum(shot_made_flag =="shot_yes"), perc_made = made/total)
show(es)
```
* We then show Effective 2 points Shooting % by Player We see that Iguodala still leads but curry perform better on 2 points. Durant has an astondinly 60% made rate!
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <-  read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df2 = filter(df,shot_type == '2PT Field Goal')
es2 = summarize(group_by(df2,name),total = n(),made = sum(shot_made_flag =="shot_yes"), perc_made = made/total)
show(es2)
```
* We then show Effective 3 points Shooting % by Player We see that thompson now performs better and we see that it's much better to make 3 points than 2 points. Iguodala has no talent in making 3 points!
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("../data/shots-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df3 = filter(df,shot_type == '3PT Field Goal')
es3 = summarize(group_by(df3,name),total = n(),made = sum(shot_made_flag =="shot_yes"), perc_made = made/total)
show(es3)
```

#Sumamry

We did an extensive research on 5 players' performances. We see that Durant and Curry are very hard working they did a lot of shots during games and they are the pillars of GSW. Also we see that its much harder to do 3 points than 2 points and your rates will kinda be averaged by large shots(Curry example). It's similar to playing card games-- if you have over 10000 games you will find that your win rate would be only around 50% and it's really hard to achieve 60%. From that perspective, Durant is a master in 2 points shot.
